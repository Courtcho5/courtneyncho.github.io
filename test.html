        <h1>PractIV: An Advanced Modular Intravenous Training System</h1>
        
        <section class="project-detail">
            <p>What began as an ambitious senior capstone project has grown into a game-changer for medical training. Developed in collaboration with the University of Washington Engineering Innovation in Health program and the Center for Research and Education in Simulation Technologies, PractIV is a modular intravenous (IV) training arm poised to revolutionize how healthcare professionals master peripheral IV insertion.

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Peripheral intravenous (IV) catheter insertion is the process of placing a small plastic tube into a vein to deliver fluids and medications. It is one of the most common medical procedures performed in hospitals worldwide. Despite its prevalence, first-attempt success rates can be as low as 44% among staff nurses, with failed attempts causing patient discomfort, treatment delays, and increased healthcare costs. The ability to successfully perform IV insertion requires both technical skill and clinical judgment: practitioners must locate suitable veins through visual inspection and touch (palpation), assess patient-specific challenges, and execute the insertion with proper technique./
Traditionally, healthcare students and professionals learn IV insertion using training devices called IV arm trainers. These are synthetic models that simulate a human arm with embedded tubes representing veins. While these trainers provide a safe environment for practice, many current models have significant limitations. They often make veins unrealistically easy to identify, lack the tactile realism of human tissue, represent only a narrow demographic (typically lean, light-skinned males), and cannot simulate the complications clinicians encounter in real patients, such as veins that roll under the skin or difficult anatomy in critically ill patients.
PractIV was developed to address these gaps through a collaboration between the University of Washington's Engineering Innovation in Health program and the Center for Research and Education in Simulation Technologies (CREST). Starting as a senior capstone project, the work has evolved into a comprehensive effort to create a more realistic, adaptable training tool. By combining advanced manufacturing techniques with direct input from clinical experts, PractIV aims to better prepare healthcare professionals for the full range of challenges they will face when performing IV insertions on actual patients, ultimately improving both clinician confidence and patient outcomes.</p>
