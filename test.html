        <h1>PractIV: An Advanced Modular Intravenous Training System</h1>
        
        <section class="project-detail">
            <p>What began as an ambitious senior capstone project has grown into a game-changer for medical training. Developed in collaboration with the University of Washington Engineering Innovation in Health program and the Center for Research and Education in Simulation Technologies, PractIV is a modular intravenous (IV) training arm poised to revolutionize how healthcare professionals master peripheral IV insertion.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Peripheral intravenous (IV) catheter insertion is the process of placing a small plastic tube into a vein to deliver fluids and medications. It is one of the most common medical procedures performed in hospitals worldwide. Despite its prevalence, first-attempt success rates can be as low as 44% among staff nurses, with failed attempts causing patient discomfort, treatment delays, and increased healthcare costs. The ability to successfully perform IV insertion requires both technical skill and clinical judgment: practitioners must locate suitable veins through visual inspection and touch (palpation), assess patient-specific challenges, and execute the insertion with proper technique.
            
            Traditionally, healthcare students and professionals learn IV insertion using training devices called IV arm trainers. These are synthetic models that simulate a human arm with embedded tubes representing veins. While these trainers provide a safe environment for practice, many current models have significant limitations. They often make veins unrealistically easy to identify, lack the tactile realism of human tissue, represent only a narrow demographic (typically lean, light-skinned males), and cannot simulate the complications clinicians encounter in real patients, such as veins that roll under the skin or difficult anatomy in critically ill patients.
            
            PractIV was developed to address these gaps through a collaboration between the University of Washington's Engineering Innovation in Health program and the Center for Research and Education in Simulation Technologies (CREST). Starting as a senior capstone project, the work has evolved into a comprehensive effort to create a more realistic, adaptable training tool. By combining advanced manufacturing techniques with direct input from clinical experts, PractIV aims to better prepare healthcare professionals for the full range of challenges they will face when performing IV insertions on actual patients, ultimately improving both clinician confidence and patient outcomes.</p>
            
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>PractIV was developed through an iterative, user-centered design process, incorporating direct feedback from nurses, clinicians, and simulation experts. The core structure consists of a 3D-printed thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) lattice engineered to mimic human soft tissue compliance, designed using SolidWorks and nTop software. This lattice was based on anatomical data from the MoHSES™ female dataset to ensure dimensional accuracy and compatibility with full-body simulation systems.
            
            A removable silicone skin sleeve (cast using Smooth-On Ecoflex™ 00-30) replicates the feel and resistance of human skin during needle insertion. Embedded artificial veins—clear silicone tubing with a co-extruded blue outer layer—provide realistic visual and tactile cues for vein identification and palpation. The trainer includes a closed-loop pressurized fluid system (5–15 mmHg) that delivers blood flashback upon successful cannulation, simulating physiological feedback.
            
            The prototype underwent multiple design iterations informed by pilot testing with IV team nurses, anesthesiologists, and EMTs. Feedback guided refinements in vein positioning, skin compliance, and insertion realism. A formal usability study was then conducted with eight participants (five nurses, one surgeon, two simulation technicians) who evaluated both PractIV and a commercial IV trainer using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and structured questionnaires assessing anatomical fidelity, educational utility, and realism.</p>
            
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>PractIV significantly outperformed the commercial trainer across multiple domains. It achieved a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 73.61 (Acceptable range), compared to 49.72 for the commercial model (Usability Concerns). Participants rated PractIV substantially higher in educational utility, including its potential to train IV access to professional competence (p = 0.043) and likelihood of curriculum adoption (p = 0.031).
                
            In anatomical fidelity assessments, PractIV received significantly higher ratings for vein coloring (p = 0.0045), skin tone (p = 0.024), vein palpation realism (p = 0.031), needle insertion feedback (p = 0.016), and soft tissue compliance (p = 0.0003). The trainer's wrist and elbow mobility were also rated as more realistic than the commercial model (p = 0.031 and p = 0.0156, respectively). Notably, vein arrangement ratings were comparable between the two trainers (p = 0.8125), suggesting opportunity for future improvement in venous branching complexity.
            
            Qualitative feedback highlighted PractIV's durability, realistic flashback system, and joint articulation as key strengths. Participants valued its anatomical accuracy and the ability to practice proper vein stabilization techniques. These findings demonstrate that PractIV provides a more realistic, educationally valuable training experience that better prepares healthcare professionals for the challenges of clinical IV placement.</p>
