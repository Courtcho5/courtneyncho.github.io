        <!-- The Challenge -->
        <section class="challenge">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                Peripheral intravenous (IV) catheter insertion is one of the most common medical 
                procedures performed in hospitals worldwide, yet first-attempt success rates among 
                staff nurses can be as low as 44%. Failed attempts cause patient discomfort, treatment 
                delays, and increased healthcare costs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Current IV training models fall short in preparing clinicians for real-world challenges:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Oversimplified anatomy</strong> makes veins unrealistically easy to identify</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of tactile realism</strong> fails to replicate the feel of human tissue</li>
                <li><strong>Limited diversity</strong> with models representing only lean, light-skinned males</li>
                <li><strong>No complication simulation</strong> such as rolling veins or fragile tissue</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These limitations mean that learners may become proficient in controlled environments 
                yet remain underprepared for the variability and complexity of actual patient care.

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>
                PractIV demonstrates that combining advanced manufacturing techniques with user-centered 
                design can produce training tools that better prepare healthcare professionals for 
                real-world challenges. The significantly higher ratings across realism, usability, and 
                educational value suggest that this approach can improve both clinician confidence and 
                patient outcomes.
