            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                Wheelchair users face significant challenges during rain, often requiring assistance to deploy 
                traditional umbrellas or rain covers. This dependence on others reduces autonomy and can limit 
                mobility during inclement weather. Many wheelchair users avoid going out in the rain entirely, 
                impacting their independence and quality of life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Existing solutions are inadequate:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Manual umbrellas</strong> require use of both hands, making wheelchair operation impossible</li>
                <li><strong>Fixed canopies</strong> obstruct visibility and are cumbersome in fair weather</li>
                <li><strong>Caregiver-dependent systems</strong> reduce user autonomy and dignity</li>
                <li><strong>No adaptive response</strong> to changing weather conditions</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our Solution</h2>
            <p>
                As Mechanical Design Team Lead, I guided a multidisciplinary engineering team through the complete 
                product development lifecycle to create a fully automated rain protection system. The device uses 
                sensor fusion and adaptive control algorithms to detect rain and automatically deploy protective 
                coverage without user intervention.

            <h3>Lessons in Assistive Technology</h3>
            <p>
                Leading this project reinforced the importance of designing with users, not just for them. Regular 
                engagement with wheelchair users and advocacy groups revealed insights that purely technical 
                approaches would have missed. The experience shaped my understanding of how engineering can create 
                meaningful impact through assistive technology that truly empowers users.
