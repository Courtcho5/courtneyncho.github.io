                    Hi I'm Courtney, a MS candidate at Northeastern University.
                    I'm a bioengineer focused on human-centered medical innovation. I work on prototyping medical devices, studying 
                    tissue mechanics, and designing accessible solutions grounded in 
                    engineering and user research.
